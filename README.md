Set of scripts that will be useful for bug hunters.<br>
Some of the scripts are helpful for "data analysis" kinda.<br>
Read  `Instalation` for installation

## üîß Installation

Clone the repo and run the setup:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sevada797/bash4hacking.git
cd bash4hacking
bash setup.sh
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools available
Just run menu for this ;)
Also I provided screen

## Intrusive Thoughts
~~Should make this thing more structured + push not useful funcs in /archive (time 2 mkdir it) + add descriptions show up during menu(), mm, yeah defo would be better.
If you are perfectionist ahh person, just keep an eye on my repo :) defo I'll make it better day by day.~~

Kinda done, still some funcs now may lack requiremenets, I may fix that also sooner or later
